# Leaflet Map Lab

A minimal vanilla HTML/CSS/JS map app using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap tiles, with a grid overlay for toolbars and widgets.

## Run

No server is required. Open `index.html` in any browser (double-click or drag into the window).

Optional: if you want a local URL (e.g. for in-editor preview or sharing), run from the project folder: `npx serve .` then open `http://localhost:3000`.

### VS Code / Cursor

- **Preview in default browser** — Press **F5** (or Run and Debug → **Preview: Default browser**). Starts the server and opens `http://localhost:3000` in your default browser. Stop the debug session to stop the server.
- **Preview in editor** — **Terminal** → **Run Task…** → **Preview in Editor**. Starts the server and opens the built-in Simple Browser. The server keeps running in the task terminal until you stop it (Ctrl+C in that terminal).

## Basemap

Uses OpenStreetMap tiles with no API key or registration required.
